in all honesty, with all the broken grammar and everything else here is my main line inspiration for this repo...

one day, both my wifi and my cell service went out... not just my cell provider but also other carriers in my area too... 
I was working a very important remote job and I had no way of communicating with them in anyway whatsoever... 
So what was I to do? I couldn't get to a landline anywhere... I can't email, I can't text, I can't do anything...
I ended up leaving town to try and find a some kind of network or cell service to essentially communicate with my employer...
Which, when I finally did... They were understanding... Thankfully... 

But I kept thinking to myself... what can I do? what can I do? what can I do? 

Then it just bothered me so much thinking "they can track our every movement even if we're offline theoretically but I can't even communicate across the country quickly right now" 

"... there needs to be a way to essentially for me to be able to tell my employer if I am offline after a certain threshold or period"

"...if my mobile or desktop device can track every swipe and keystroke but there's no signal to communicate that data then it's all useless..."

"...but wait, if a device so prone to tracking and data collection isn't collecting anything and is ultimately not receiving any kind of inputs at all... "

"... then we can possibly use that as a signal in and of itself" 

Then that's how I came onto Zero Signal Protocol.
If we're being watched at every second, why not utilize that to our advantage and I literally thought to myself "well, abscence and inactviity is a signal theoretically, so why not use that?" 

Anyway, that's my silly inspiration. 

Hopefully it can help someone one day... the other thing I thought of too is when people go missing for any number of reasons by the time people notice they're gone it's often far too late... 

For such a "surveilled and documented world", there's still these anomalies that slip thru the cracks and evil that still passes by unchecked... 

Stay well, stay healthy and always strive to improve yourself and our universe friends
