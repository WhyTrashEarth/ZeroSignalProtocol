# Zero Signal Protocol (ZSP)

*A digital absence signalling system — when silence matters, ZSP speaks.*

---

## 🧭 Why ZSP Exists

We live in a world of constant digital surveillance and 24/7 tracking.  
Rather than reject that reality, **Zero Signal Protocol (ZSP)** turns it into a tool for protection and autonomy.

By letting individuals decide *how their absence is communicated*, ZSP transforms passive monitoring into an **opt-in safety net** — a way to protect ourselves and others when silence could otherwise be mistaken for neglect, ghosting, or disappearance.

This project is about **reclaiming control** of our digital presence.  
You decide the thresholds. You decide who gets notified. You decide when silence speaks.

## 🌍 Overview

Zero Signal Protocol (ZSP) is a voluntary, opt-in system that lets individuals and organizations define what happens when their **digital activity stops**.  
It’s a modern “digital failsafe,” turning passive surveillance into a **safety and autonomy tool**.

With ZSP you can:

- Set custom timeouts (e.g., 18 hours, 48 hours, 7 days)  
- Automatically notify trusted contacts, post to social media, or trigger a webhook  
- Use it for safety, mental health, or simply clearer communication (“I’m off-grid, don’t worry”)  

ZSP flips the script: *no activity* can itself become a **signal**.

## ✨ Example Use Cases

- **Solo Travelers:** 24h no phone unlock → send SMS to family  
- **Mental Health Check-In:** 7-day silent window → tweet “I’m okay, just off-grid”  
- **Public Figures / Activists:** Zero activity across multiple platforms → private alert to team  
- **Child Safety:** Device silent >12h → silent ping to parent
